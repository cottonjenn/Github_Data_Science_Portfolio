# Hello! I'm Jenna 

Welcome to my data science portfolio! 

I'm a Statistics and Data Science major at BYU from Houston, Texas.
This site shows my journey learning data science and analytics. Here you'll find projects that demonstrate what I've learned and discovered.

Check out the About Me tab to know more about me and my background. 

## Overview

This portfolio shows my work learning data science which includes:

- Tutorial Blog made in markdown explaining a simple SQL topic for Data Science
- Projects in my Data Science class (BYU Stat 386) coded in Python and markdown

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
