    "text": "Golf is a globally popular sport centered on precision and consistency. Players aim to complete a course in as few strokes as possible, navigating anywhere from 100 to over 600 yards from the tee box to the hole while avoiding strategically placed obstacles. This project investigates the spatial and strategic elements of professional golf, with an initial focus on both the number of strokes remaining to hole out, and the variability associated with this estimate. Using data from the first hole of the 2023 Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass—comprising 1,764 strokes taken by 139 unique golfers, including coordinate locations and lie characteristics—we have mapped and transformed this data into a structured format, incorporating shapefiles of the golf course and applying spatial transformations. Through exploratory analysis, we aim to understand spatial variation in stroke progression. Current efforts focus on refining and interpreting this analysis, laying the groundwork for future modeling of stroke progression. The ultimate goal is to estimate, with uncertainty, the predicted number of strokes remaining for any location on the hole, enabling more informed strategies for playing the course.",
